AgentHarness Developer Vision

AgentHarness is a desktop orchestrator for autonomous, LLM-driven software development. It turns a rough idea into a structured spec, a tracked task plan, and a repeatable execution loop, while keeping developers in control of every stage.

Vision
Build the most reliable and transparent local workflow for AI-assisted software delivery: fast iteration, explicit state, and clear artifacts that developers can audit and extend.

Intended Users
- Developers and small teams who want an interactive, local-first agent loop.
- Engineers who need multiple LLM providers/models in a single workflow.
- Builders who want automation but still want explicit control of risky steps.

Core Workflow (Developer-Facing)
1) Input a project description in the GUI.
2) The system generates clarifying, multiple-choice questions; answers become structured inputs.
3) A full project description and a task checklist are generated and surfaced with progress tracking.
4) The execution loop completes exactly one task per iteration and records recent changes.
5) Review loops run through multiple lenses (architecture, efficiency, safety, testing, docs, UI/UX), followed by fix passes.
6) Optional git operations can commit locally or push remotely with explicit approval.
7) The run can be paused, stopped, resumed later, or continued with a new prompt after completion.

Design Principles For Developers
- Transparent automation: every stage emits logs and artifacts that can be inspected.
- One task at a time: progress is explicit and reversible.
- Multi-LLM by design: pick a different model per stage and allow mid-run switches.
- Safe defaults: warnings for risky configs, clear stop controls, and format guardrails.
- Resumable sessions: long-running work can be saved and continued without losing context.

Operational Expectations
- Clear status indicators for phase, iteration, and active agent.
- Log filtering with readable output for long runs.
- Provider limit detection with a prompt to switch LLMs.
- Review loops can skip or stop when no findings remain.
- File-based artifacts (tasks, description, recent changes, reviews, session state) are the source of truth.

Long-Term Direction
- Support for a broader set of LLMs, models, and API key setups.
- Smarter reviewer orchestration (multiple reviewers and fixers).
- Ability to add or reprioritize tasks from the UI at any point.
- Optional UI diagnostics, such as capturing screenshots for UI-specific debugging.
