# gui Developer Guide

## Purpose
Implements the PySide6 UI layer. The main window orchestrates the workflow, connects signals, and coordinates worker threads.

## Contents
- `main_window.py`: Application controller and UI shell. Wires panels, manages phase transitions, and delegates worker execution to mixins.
- `settings_mixin.py`: Settings handlers used by `MainWindow` (save/load project settings, configuration/LLM/review/debug settings dialog wiring, `File -> Open Project...` project switching via the same startup directory picker, left panel tab visibility control for logs/description/tasks, and automatic per-working-directory settings sync under `.agentharness/project-settings.json`). UI defaults are all hidden left tabs unless a directory settings file enables them. Settings are automatically saved when the application closes to preserve UI state between sessions, and LLM selections are also persisted immediately when the LLM settings dialog closes.
- `workflow_runner.py`: Worker execution mixin for planning, execution, review, and git phases.
- `theme.py`: Centralized Qt Fusion stylesheet plus helper utilities for button variants and fade-in animations. It defines the global typography scale (base font, inputs, group titles, buttons, hero labels, and list-item spacing) used across dialogs and widgets, including explicit checkbox indicator border styling for clearer checkbox frames.
- `widgets/`: Reusable UI panels (description with Edit/Preview/Task List modes and automatic mode switching during iteration, hidden question-flow bridge, logs, config, status, LLM selection).
- `dialogs/`: Modal dialogs (git approval, review settings, debug settings, startup working-directory selection, keyboard-first question answering).
- `__init__.py`: Module marker.

## Key Interactions
- `MainWindow` owns the `StateMachine` and a `QThreadPool`, and mixes in worker handlers from `WorkflowRunnerMixin`.
- `main.py` shows `dialogs/startup_directory_dialog.py` before creating `MainWindow`; app startup now requires selecting a working directory and supports recent-directory shortcuts.
- `File -> Open Project...` reuses `dialogs/startup_directory_dialog.py` during runtime, including the same recent-directory list behavior used at startup.
- After directory selection, `MainWindow` defaults to a minimalist two-column composition: optional left tab panel (hidden by default) and right chat panel (always visible). The left panel can contain up to 3 independently toggleable tabs (Logs, Description, Tasks) controlled via `View` menu. The status panel (top bar) is always visible and shows current phase, iteration count, sub-status details, and task-based progress. Workflow commands are exposed in the `Workflow` menu with shortcuts and menu bar icon buttons.
- Workflow start is exposed through the `Workflow` menu and the top-right menu bar icon buttons; there is no floating start button in the content area.
- Start/Play is enabled whenever the workflow is not actively running (`IDLE`, `PAUSED`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`, or `ERROR`) and no worker is currently active. `Pause` resumes from the same phase/sub-phase, while `Stop` cancels the current run and the next Start begins a fresh main-loop run.
- The menu bar includes workflow control icon buttons (Start/Play, Pause, Stop, Next Step) positioned in the top-right corner for quick access. These mirror the functionality of the Workflow menu items. Control buttons row has been removed - all workflow controls are accessible via menu bar icons and Workflow menu actions. IMPORTANT: The corner widget container (`menu_button_container`) must be stored as a member variable to prevent Qt from prematurely deleting it and its child buttons. Updates to menu buttons include RuntimeError exception handling to gracefully handle Qt object lifetime edge cases.
- `MainWindow` also controls debug-step gating for every LLM call through `Settings -> Debug Settings` and a `Next Step` button in the menu bar.
- The same workflow controls are always accessible from `Workflow` menu actions (`Start/Resume`, `Pause`, `Stop`, `Next Step`) and the menu bar icon buttons.
- After Q&A rewrite, when the app is waiting for the user decision, the Start/Play control is also enabled from `Phase.AWAITING_ANSWERS` (only when answers are already submitted and no worker is running) and routes directly to task planning.
- Worker results and log output are streamed back to UI via `WorkerSignals`.
- `workflow_runner.py` handles git-phase completion defensively: if the git result payload is malformed or `tasks.md` cannot be read after commit, it logs recovery diagnostics, attempts to recreate required workflow files, and avoids silent loop stalls by transitioning to a controlled error state on unexpected exceptions. It also refreshes Tasks-tab counters/lists immediately when chat processing updates `tasks.md`, and now posts explicit chat milestone messages after planning/execution/review/git completion (including a unit-test-prep completion message before review starts).
- Error recovery skip paths in `workflow_runner.py` use the original failed phase captured in the error context (not `Phase.ERROR`), first transition out of error to `IDLE`, then continue skip behavior (for loop phases, continue main execution; for unsupported phases, return to `IDLE`).
- During `MAIN_EXECUTION`/`DEBUG_REVIEW`/`GIT_OPERATIONS` (and `COMPLETED`), `MainWindow` automatically switches `widgets/description_panel.py` to Task List mode, which replaces the main content area with task progress information: current action, completed/incomplete counts, and tabbed Markdown-rendered task lists (All/Completed/Incomplete filters) sourced from `tasks.md`. The view mode controls (Preview/Task List buttons) are automatically shown during these phases.
- The top-right status-bar progress percentage is driven by task completion ratio from `tasks.md`, not by max-iteration count; during active loop phases it is phase-weighted so a task's full percent is reached only after git operations finish for that cycle.
- UI panels emit signals for user actions (start/pause/stop, batch question answers, settings changes); question answering is handled in a modal keyboard-driven window that cannot be dismissed until final submission, while `MainWindow` keeps `product-description.md` synced with the description widget, force-syncs the current GUI description to `product-description.md` before each question batch and before task planning, initializes an empty `questions.json` before each question batch, rewrites only the current submitted Q&A batch into `product-description.md` right after answers are submitted using the dedicated `description_molding` stage, then updates the description widget from `product-description.md` only for that rewrite step, posts a chat bubble confirming that the product description was updated from those answers, clears stored Q&A context so the rewritten description becomes the new baseline, and keeps configuration/LLM settings live-editable so updates apply to upcoming phases and iterations. Expected rewrite-time file watcher events are auto-loaded without prompting; unexpected external edits now show a choice dialog (`Load External Changes` or `Keep Current Description`, where keep overwrites the file from current UI state). After each rewrite, `question_panel.py` opens a non-modal decision dialog with four options: ask more questions, open a dedicated product-description editor, continue back to the main window, or start task planning. In this post-answer state, the status phase label changes to `Ready to Continue`.
- `MainWindow` drives chat UX lifecycle hooks: it always appends user chat entries. If the in-memory description is empty, it first re-reads `product-description.md` from the working directory and hydrates UI/state when content exists; only truly empty projects use first-message initialization (save first message as initial `product-description.md`, then trigger question generation). While description is empty, chat checkbox controls are disabled and the send button text is `Create initial description`; once description exists, checkboxes are enabled and the button text switches to `Send Message`. When all three chat checkboxes are unchecked, the message is routed through a headless wrapper prompt that tells the LLM the user only sees `answer.md`; checkbox selections use specialized prompt templates. It maps phase/status updates into friendly rotating activity messages (question generation, task planning, research-within-planning, execution, unit-test prep, review, fix, git, and client-message handling), clears activity when the workflow is no longer actively working, and posts one-line bot completion messages for key milestones (for example when questions are ready). Activity phrase pools now provide about 10 rotating lines per phase/sub-phase so the spinner messaging stays contextual throughout the main loop. Chat activity is also explicitly cleared when a client-message worker completes so stale "working" bubbles do not linger. Chat input shortcuts are `Enter` to send and `Shift+Enter` to insert a newline. The chat panel auto-follows new content only when the user is near the bottom; manual scroll position is preserved when browsing older messages, and animation-only spinner refreshes are skipped while the user is away from the bottom to keep manual scrolling responsive during active runs. When a client message leaves `answer.md` empty, the completion bubble always reports file outcomes: tasks updates reference the Tasks tab, description updates reference the Description tab, and no file changes produce `nothing done`.
- `MainWindow.on_working_dir_changed` updates `StateContext.working_directory` immediately when directory selection changes, so chat-triggered workers and pre-start actions use the selected project path.
- `MainWindow` initializes working-directory artifacts as soon as a valid directory is active (including the startup default path), including pre-creating `review/<type>.md` files for all active review types.
- When opening a non-empty folder that has no product description content, `MainWindow` prompts whether it is an existing project and offers auto-generating `product-description.md` from the current codebase. If accepted, it opens an inline provider/model picker dialog and runs an LLM bootstrap pass that only writes `product-description.md` (does not overwrite existing governance files such as `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `GEMINI.md`).
- When a user switches to a working directory that already contains incomplete checklist items in `tasks.md`, `MainWindow` prompts: "There are incomplete tasks in this project. Would you like to complete them?" If accepted, a second dialog prompts for the number of iterations to run. Upon confirmation, the workflow automatically starts and skips question/planning to resume directly in main execution against the existing tasks. This same two-step prompt (incomplete tasks confirmation + iteration count) also appears at startup if the default working directory contains incomplete tasks, and the workflow auto-starts after the iteration count is confirmed.
- A "Resume Tasks" button appears in the status panel when the app is in `IDLE`, `COMPLETED`, or `CANCELLED` phase and there are incomplete tasks in `tasks.md`. Clicking this button prompts for iteration count, then jumps directly into main execution for the incomplete tasks.
- When max iterations are reached but incomplete tasks remain, a popup dialog appears with a system beep, asking "x/x iterations complete. There are still tasks incomplete. Would you like to keep going?" with an input box to specify additional iterations. If the user accepts, the max iteration limit is increased and execution continues; otherwise, the workflow transitions to `COMPLETED`.
- `ConfigPanel` performs git repository bootstrap as soon as the working directory is set (including app startup default directory) and is rechecked immediately before task planning starts from the question flow: it ensures the directory is a git repo and applies configured `origin` remote URL. Git subprocess checks in this flow use a 10-second timeout.
- `LLMSelectorPanel` seeds default provider/model values per stage at UI setup (including `description_molding`, post-planning `research`, and `unit_test_prep`); current defaults follow the codex/claude profile (`question_gen` codex low, `description_molding`/`research`/`task_planning` claude sonnet 4.6, `coder`/`reviewer` codex, `fixer` claude opus 4.6, `unit_test_prep` codex, `git_ops`/`client_message_handler` codex low). The selectors are edited from `Settings -> LLM Settings`, while `MainWindow` stores values in `StateContext.llm_config` and keeps them synced during execution. The stages are displayed in execution order. The LLM settings dialog also supports saving/loading reusable LLM config JSON files.
- Review labels shown in UI/logs use `PromptTemplates.get_review_display_name`.

## MainWindow Responsibilities
- Validate inputs, read config, and seed `StateContext`.
- Schedule workers for each phase and route worker outputs.
- Update UI state (enable/disable panels, status bar, activity panel).
- Manage working directory artifacts via `FileManager`.
- Manage session save/resume through `SessionManager`.
- Expose menu actions including `Settings -> LLM Settings` for stage provider/model choices.
- Expose menu actions including `File -> Open Project...` for startup-style project switching with recent-directory shortcuts.
- Expose menu actions including `Settings -> Configuration Settings` for execution controls and working directory/git remote.
- Expose menu actions including `Settings -> Review Settings`, which opens a dialog with separate sections for one-time pre-review unit-test prep and per-iteration review-loop type selection.
- Expose menu actions including `Settings -> Debug Settings` (which also controls left logs-panel visibility).
- Expose menu actions for `Workflow` (run controls) and `View` (left panel tab toggles) to preserve a minimalist default layout. The View menu provides 3 toggles: Show Logs (left tab), Show Description (left tab), and Show Tasks (left tab). All tabs default to hidden. The left panel only appears when at least one tab is enabled. The right column always contains only the chat panel, never showing description or tasks above it. The status panel is always visible at the top of the window.
