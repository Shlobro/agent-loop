# .claude Developer Guide

## Purpose
Holds local Claude Code configuration for this repository. This folder is not part of the application runtime; it exists to control assistant permissions and behavior during development.

## Contents
- `settings.local.json`: Local permission allow-list used by Claude tooling. Defines which tool invocations are permitted when running in this repo.

## How It Fits
This configuration is read by the Claude Code client, not by the application. It does not affect the PySide6 app or any runtime behavior.

## Change Map
- Adjust tool permissions or allowed commands: edit `settings.local.json`.
